					"“There is a voice that doesn’t use words. Listen”",
					"(Rumi, 11th century Persian poet)",
					" ",
					"It is common with trauma to brace against inner sensations and stiffen muscles, often around the neck and shoulder area. Bracing serves to keep someone on high alert, ready to act in response to danger. But that response can get over programmed in the body. Addressing bracing and tension involves tackling it where it lives- and yoga does that.",
					" ",
					"You can’t change irrational bodily responses unless you pay attention to the messages from your body, be quiet, attentive and explore the sensations. It is important to distinguish the physical body from the emotions and untangle thoughts and feelings from body sensations. You have to befriend your own bodily sensations to overcome the residue of trauma. You have to feel safe in your own body and deactivate the sense memories of trauma.",
					" ",
					"Bessel van der Kolk, MD, a renowned trauma researcher said, “For real change to take place, the body needs to learn that the danger has passed and to live in the reality of the present”.",
					" ",
					"With yoga, you learn to be still and tolerate sensation- not react in an old patterned response- therefore deactivating it. If you calm the body you calm the mind. A calmer body results in a calmer mind. You can engage in activities that help promote a sense of safety. In fact, research has shown that allowing yourself to rest in savasana or final resting pose promotes a sense of safety.",
					" ",
					"Mindfulness is”Paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the present moment without judgment”.",
					" ",
					"Mindfulness helps you interrupt the patterns of reacting, take a step back, observe and be less critical of your thoughts and experiences. After all, those reactions were survival oriented, meant to protect you and keep you in a state of readiness to respond to danger and perceived threat. Your mind and body have to reset and move out of that constant state of readiness and guard. The goal is to feel safely embodied and trust that you can take action to heal.",
					" ",
					"Trauma-informed or trauma sensitive yoga is a means of reconnecting to the body and rewiring the overactive stress response. Finding stillness and exploring sensation in a safe way is the goal and reconnecting to yourself in a careful and gentle way. While the movements may seem simple, these movements promote a kind of grounding in your body and rewire the brain to promote peace and calm.",

					"When the pandemic began, there were constant changes at the Village.  Some departments had to close temporarily, operations in the kitchens have changed- closure of both dining rooms, meals are being plated and handed to residents/clients who have to take them and leave to eat. The number of servers per meal has decreased to 3 people per meal but we are still serving our neighbors in need, out of two kitchens on site.",
					"We are practicing social distancing and all FJV staff, volunteers, clients, and visitors must bring and wear a mask when at the Village. The kitchens are still providing gloves, hair nets, aprons, and face shields upon request.",
					"We have plexi-glass separating those receiving meals and volunteers.  The task is only serving food onto the plates, covering with foil or saran wrap and handing through the plexi-glass. Also, handing out salad, dessert, fruit, or milk through the window slot. We really only need 3 people since we need to consider the chef and food service staff in the kitchen to respect the spatial distancing order. The kitchens still provide hairnets, aprons, gloves, and face shield upon request. Volunteers are required to bring their own face mask.",
